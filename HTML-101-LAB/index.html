    <h1>Dogs</h1>
   
    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <p>Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or
        groups)
        to internal and external stimuli.[57] As the oldest <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog#Domestication" target="_blank" alt="wiki page of dogs">domesticated</a> species, dogs' minds inevitably have
        been
        shaped by
        millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs have acquired the
        ability to
        understand and communicate with humans more than any other species and they are uniquely attuned to human
        behaviors.[11]
        Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs. These
        abilities
        are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, such as great apes,
        but
        rather parallel to children's social-cognitive skill</p>

    <h2>Breeds</h2>
    <p>Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds.[9] In the Victorian
        era,
        directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes.[7] Most
        breeds
        were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years,[7][9] and since then dogs have undergone
        rapid
        phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to artificial selection imposed by humans. The
        skull,
        body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity
        than can be
        found within the entire order of carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which
        include
        body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour.[7] Their behavioural traits include guarding,
        herding, and
        hunting,[7] retrieving, and scent detection. Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness,
        and
        aggression,[9] which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs.[7] As a result, today dogs
        are the
        most abundant carnivore species and are dispersed around the world.[9] The most striking example of this
        dispersal is
        that of the numerous modern breeds of European lineage during the Victorian era</p>

    <h2>Roles with humans</h2>
    <p>Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from their wolf ancestors, which would have
        been
        pack hunters with a complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may
        account
        for their trainability, playfulness and ability to fit into human households and social situations. These
        attributes
        have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful animals
        today.[99]

        The dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures.
        Dogs
        perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the
        military,
        companionship and aiding disabled individuals. This influence on human society has given them the nickname
        "man's best
        friend" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of meat.[100][101]</p>
